Shadowsocks-NaCl
================

Shadowsocks-NaCl is a Native Client port of shadowsocks,
provides high performance crypto and network relay on
web browser which support Native Client.

**Note:** This port of shadowsocks is **for Web App developer ONLY**, **NOT** for the end user.
For end user, use [shadowsocks-chromeapp](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-chromeapp) instead.


Build
-----
1. Download and install [Native Client SDK](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/download).
2. Set environment variable `NACL_SDK_ROOT` to SDK path (e.g., `~/nacl_sdk/pepper_47`).
3. Checkout [webports](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webports.git/), a.k.a. naclports.
4. Follow the instructions in `webports/README.md` to install webports.
5. Build and install OpenSSL to Native Client SDK. (e.g., `$ NACL_ARCH=pnacl make openssl`)
6. (For webports version less than `pepper_47`)
   Update libsodium in webports form `0.4.5` to `1.0.3` since ChaCha20 had been add from `0.6.0`.
   You may change the content of `webports/src/ports/libsodium/pkg_info` to

    ```
    NAME=libsodium
    VERSION=1.0.3
    URL=https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.3/libsodium-1.0.3.tar.gz
    LICENSE=ISC
    SHA1=e44ed485842966d4e2d8f58e74a5fd78fbfbe4b0
    ```
7. Build and install libsodium to Native Client SDK. (e.g., `$ NACL_ARCH=pnacl make libsodium`)
8. Clone this repository and use `$ make` to build.


Usage
-----
**Note**: It is recommend to use Shadowsocks-NaCl JavaScript API to communicate
with native client module. You just need include `src/shadowsocks.js` into your
webapp page, initialize it, and invoke commands you need. For more details, see
example in `test_flight.js` and read jsdoc in `src/shadowsocks.js`.

Also, you can do all things by yourself.

First, put an `<embed>` tag into webpage to load Native Client module, like:

```html
<embed id="shadowsocks"
       width=0 height=0
       src="/pnacl/Release/shadowsocks.nmf"
       type="application/x-pnacl" />
```

Then you can use `postMessage()` API to connect with Native Client module.

Currently, shadowsocks-nacl accepts four types of command.

1. Command: `connect`. You can use it connect to a remote server.

    ```javascript

    document.querySelector("#shadowsocks").postMessage({
        cmd: "connect",
        arg: {
            server: "example.com",  // Value must be a string
            server_port: 8388,      // Value must be a number
            local_port: 1080,       // Value must be a number
            method: "aes-256-cfb",  // Value must be a string and in supported method list
            password: "password"    // Value must be a string
            timeout: 300            // Value in seconds and must be a number
        }
    });
   ```

2. Command: `disconnect`. You can use it to disconnect from a remote server.

    ```javascript
    document.querySelector("#shadowsocks").postMessage({
        cmd: "disconnect"
    });

    ```

3. Command: `sweep`. You should run this command repatedly in fixed time to sweep "deadly" connection.

    ```javascript
    setInterval(function() {
        document.querySelector("#shadowsocks").postMessage({
            cmd: "sweep"
        });
    }, 120 * 1000);
    ```

4. Command: `version`. Invoke this command can log version to console.

    ```javascript
    document.querySelector("#shadowsocks").postMessage({
        cmd: "version"
    });
    ```

Test flight
----------
A Chromium App is provided to help testing and debugging.

You can open `chrome://extensions/`, check `Developer Mode`,
click `Load Unpacked Extension`, select the root directory of this project.

You will find a new App named `Shadowsocks NaCl Test flight` in `chrome://extensions/`,
click `Inspect views: background page` will open a developer tools window and you can try
above-mentioned command here.
